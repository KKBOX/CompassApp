[Compass.app](http://compass.handlino.com/) helps designers compile stylesheets easily without resorting to command line interface. It is written in Java and works in Windows/Linux/Mac OS X.

[Compass](http://compass-style.org/) is a stylesheet authoring framework that makes your stylesheets and markup easier to build and maintain. With compass, you write your stylesheets in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) instead of CSS.
